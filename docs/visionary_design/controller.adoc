=== Design Principles

* Regional Scope, AZ resilience
* Simple network resource abstraction
* Loosely coupled components for flexible partitioning and easy scale out
* Top-down configuration driving towards eventual consistency
* Decoupling among services
** Database access only through service
** Isolation of database access and cache on the service level
** Enable flexible partitioning for various services

== Micro-Service Framework

== Availability Zone Resilience

== Service-to-Service Communication

== Design Proposals

=== Proposal A: Database centric design

OpenStack
Various business logics (implemented via plugin) access to the same database.
Each service accesses to SQL database with DAO/ADO library.

=== Proposal B: API server centric design

Kubenetes
Various business logics access to one (partitioned) database through API services. 

=== Proposal C: Service centric design

Service mesh

=== Proposal Comparison & Decision

|====================
|Design|Pros|Cons
|Option 1: Database centric design |Business logic coupling causing maintainence/upgrade challenges, business intra-interference and deep database coupling |
|Option 2: API server centric design | | Simplied database access by standard API calls 
|Option 3: Service centric design| |
